# What to expect at a JuniorDev event?
 
Fun! :smile: 

In addition to being a fun and friendly environment, we work to be a diverse and inclusive community that adds knowledge and value to our peers!

Being a speaker at our event means that you too are apart of crafting this awesome experience for all. Junior Devs are a great audience, they appreciate personal stories, relatable experiences, they are friendly and honest! They’re prone to asking questions, but they come from a place of curiosity and inquisitiveness, which is awesome. Sometimes they’re shy too, and won’t laugh as hard at a joke or put their hands up if asked a question, so it’s something to be prepared for.

What does diversity and inclusion look like for a speaker? In addition to following our Code of Conduct, there’s a few points that are specific to speakers.

In your slides, if you use people images, have the images represent a diverse range of people, like age, gender, ethnicity, roles.
Don’t bag out on other programming languages, you will ultimately alienate people in the room as there will be people in the room who use that language. There’s a difference between having an opinion and just make a joke at the expense of another language.
Avoid addressing the attendees as “guys”. Folk, peeps, Junior Devs, everyone, there’s a bunch of alternatives.

# Code of Conduct

If you haven't already, please read through our Code of Conduct: https://github.com/juniordevio/community_docs/blob/master/Code_Of_Conduct.md


# What do you need from us?

If you are doing a session that requires anything outside of a projector and a lectern, let us know in advance. An extra table for something you rest on? A stand for a demonstration item? A stool to sit on? We can accommodate most requests with advanced notice.


# What to bring

Your laptop is the best bet, unless you’ve arranged something directly with us to display your slides. Don’t have slides? No worries, just bring yourself and whatever you need!
 
This will sound silly, but dress however you want! There's no expectations from us on this.

If you want to bring stickers or small merchandise from your company or projects, that’s great! Please have a chat if it’s anything other than that though!


# Audio and Visual

You can use slides but it’s not a requirement. We have some AV requirements for this event, including submitting your slides prior to the event, we'll fill you in closer to the date.
 
 
# When you arrive

We will let you know what time to arrive in an email, please check in with us and let us know you have arrived.

You’re welcome to the drinks, food, stickers, just like everyone else! It’s great if you mingle and chat, but we know it can be a bit unnerving before a talk, so if you need to find a quiet space, please do so.


# Questions

Unless you’ve stated otherwise, you can expect questions from the audience and / or the MC. Depending on time, this might be one question, or many. Questions are valuable ways to engage with the attendees, and to expand on points, clarify anything. You can always pass on questions. Please let us know if you don’t want to take questions prior to the event. Question time is limited and the MC will pick the people and conduct question time.


# Catering

We cater by default for vegetarian and gluten free, if you have other dietary requirements beyond this please let us know prior to the event.
 

# Marketing
 
In promoting the event, we’ll be creating some marketing materials and posting details of your talk on the Meetup event page and also on our social media:

Twitter handle or social media details (if available) so we can tag you in our posts
Brief description of your talk and what do you
A photo of you so we can create a Canva banner 



# Social Media
We love Social Media! But we understand that not everybody does. If you don’t want to feature on our Social Media please advise us before the event.

Our Twitter Handle is @JuniorDev_io and we love getting tagged in tweets!

It’s good to let people know you are speaking, there’s nothing wrong with being proud of your achievement, so shout from the rooftops if you want!

Supporting the other speakers on the night itself can be really rewarding, you are sharing an experience and sharing highlights from their session can be great too. We’ll provide you with information on the other speakers prior to the event.


# Contact

The JuniorDev organisers are the best point of contact before, during and after the event. Often there are other volunteers that help out at events, including from the host venue, who can help out in general, we ask that anything of an important nature should be directed to us.
